## Component Architecture

### Frontend Components

Our frontend is built with a modular, component-based architecture to promote reusability and maintainability.

#### Core Components
- **ListingCard**: A summary card for a single property, used on the `PropertiesPage`.
- **PropertySearchBox**: A form for searching properties by city with autocomplete functionality.
- **PropertyMap**: An interactive Leaflet map that displays a property's location using geocoding.
- **PriceHistoryChart**: A Chart.js graph visualizing the price history trends of a property.

#### AI & Analysis Components
- **AiAnalysisButton**: Triggers AI-powered property analysis using OpenAI integration.
- **Analysis Results Display**: Renders formatted AI analysis with market insights and price predictions.
- **AnalysisCache**: Backend caching system for optimizing AI API calls and improving performance.

#### UI & Utility Components
- **ScoreBadge**: Displays Walk Score, Transit Score, and Bike Score for property locations.
- **ImageGallery**: A responsive carousel for viewing property images.
- **RealtorInfo**: Shows contact information for the listing agent with social links.
- **SimpleToast**: A non-blocking notification system for user feedback.
- **Action Buttons**: A suite of interactive buttons (`FavoriteButton`, `ScheduleButton`, `RoiCalculatorButton`) for user interactions on the `PropertyDetailPage`.

### Backend Architecture

The backend is a Django REST API application with integrated AI capabilities that provides comprehensive property management and intelligent analysis services.

#### Django Apps Structure
- **listings**: The core application managing all property-related data and AI analysis.
  - **Models**: `Listing`, `PriceHistory`, and `AnalysisCache` define the database schema.
  - **Views**: RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations, search functionality, and AI analysis proxy.
  - **Serializers**: Manages the conversion of complex data types (Django models) to JSON responses.
  - **URLs**: Defines comprehensive API endpoint routes including AI analysis endpoints.

#### AI Integration Layer
- **OpenAI Integration**: Direct integration with OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for property market analysis.
- **Analysis Caching**: Intelligent caching system using `AnalysisCache` model to optimize API costs and response times.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompt templates for consistent and professional real estate analysis reports.

## Data Flow

### Property Search & View Flow
1.  A user on the `PropertiesPage` uses the `PropertySearchBox`.
2.  The frontend makes a GET request to the `/api/listings/search/?city={city}` endpoint.
3.  The Django backend filters listings by city and returns the data.
4.  The results are displayed as a series of `ListingCard` components.
5.  Clicking a card navigates the user to the `PropertyDetailPage`, passing the property ID in the URL. The previous search page number is preserved in the URL (`?page=2`) for improved navigation.
6.  The `PropertyDetailPage` fetches detailed data for that property and renders components like `ImageGallery`, `PropertyMap`, and `PriceHistoryChart`.

### User Authentication Flow
1.  A new user navigates to the `RegisterPage` and fills out the registration form.
2.  Client-side validation is performed instantly using the `InputValidation` tool.
3.  Upon submission, a request is sent to Firebase Authentication to create a new user.
4.  Once registered, the user's authentication state is managed globally by `AuthContext`.
5.  Authenticated users can log in via the `LoginPage`.
6.  The main navigation bar dynamically changes based on the user's auth state, showing either login/register links or a user dashboard/logout menu.
7.  Protected actions, like AI analysis and favoriting properties, check the `AuthContext` and prompt unauthenticated users to log in.

### AI-Powered Property Analysis Flow
1.  An authenticated user clicks the "Magic LynAI" button on a `PropertyDetailPage`.
2.  The frontend sends a POST request to `/api/listings/analyze-housing/` with the property listing ID.
3.  The Django backend checks the `AnalysisCache` for existing analysis to avoid duplicate OpenAI API calls.
4.  If no cache exists, the system generates a structured prompt including property details and price history.
5.  The backend calls OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo API with the engineered prompt for market analysis.
6.  The AI response is cached in `AnalysisCache` and returned to the frontend with structured analysis including:
   - Market Analysis Summary
   - Price Trend Analysis  
   - Future Price Predictions
   - Key Factors & Recommendations
7.  The frontend renders the formatted analysis with proper styling and user-friendly presentation.
